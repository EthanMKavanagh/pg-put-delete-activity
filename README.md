We've got a basic bookstore! We're ready to add a new feature required by our users -- the ability to update our books and delete them from our inventory.


## DATABASE SETUP

Full SQL for adding all the books can be found in the database.sql file. Load the file into Postico by clicking on **Load query...**, select all of the queries (cmd + a) and click **Execute Selection**. [SQL lecture notes for reference](https://github.com/PrimeAcademy/antares-syllabus/blob/master/lecture_notes/03-01_sql_intro.md).

## Base Mode

- [ ] DELETE & EDIT AJAX 
- [ ] Clear form on submit 
- [ ] DELETE & EDIT SERVER SIDE 

## Stretch Goals

- [ ] Add publisher & year -- you'll have to change a lot!
- [ ] Improve the styling of the page
- [ ] Add validation
- [ ] Change the sort order
